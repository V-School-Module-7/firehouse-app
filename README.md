>   Application for firefighters and paramedics to easily search for information on drug and protocol administration while in certain counties.
> Currently, they are relegated to dredging through numerous PDFs to find the information they need. This is not user-friendly or efficient
> for potentially life-saving measures. We aim to remedy this with our app.

>   Firebase Storage is being used to store the PDFs that the app will use. Firebase essentially stores the files and provides a link to each file that includes a unique
> access token. We use that link in our database to pull the files for the app.
