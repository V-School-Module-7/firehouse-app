                    "VEIS is a tactic used by many fire departments throughout the nation. If victims are trapped inside of a burning structure, it is important to get them out as soon as possible. While engine companies begin to enter the structure and search for the fire, rescue crews can begin rescue operations.",
                    "VEIS operations are typically conducted through a window as a means of access and egress. Whether on the main floor, basement or second floor and above, the approach is similar. Generally, a main floor rescue will not require a ladder, whereas in a basement or a rescue on a multistory structure will require ladder deployment. It is important this tactic is conducted as an organized operations, properly communicated and authorized by incident command."

To control ventilation and fire spread, leave the window intact until you are on air, on the ladder and prepared to enter the structure. Ensure that the ladder is placed below the windowsill to accommodate rescue. With a tool, break the glass and clear the entire window by removing all obstructions prior to entry. Before entry, sweep the floor with a tool to identify potential victims that may be below the window."

With one firefighter inside the structure, a second firefighter or officer should be positioned at the window on the ladder with a TIC (Thermal Imaging Camera) for the safety of the firefighter inside and to locate any victims that may be inside.",
                    "The priority of the firefighter inside the structure is to locate the door. If the door is closed, check the door to see if it is hot by using the back of your hand. Open the door to check fire conditions of the hall and possible victims on the other side."

If smoke is entering the room of entry, isolating the room from the main fire will help prevent inadvertent fire spread due to changing the flow path of heat and smoke as well as improve visibility for firefighters and improve conditions inside the room for possible victims."

Utilize the firefighter at the window ith the TIC as a point of reference and as a resource to quickly identify possible victims. While searching the compartment, remain audible so you are detectable to possible victims and the firefighter at the window.",
                    "If a victim is found, communicate with the firefighter at the window. The firefighter inside the structure should then begin moving the victim to the window while the other firefighter communicates the information to the incident commander. The victim should then be removed from the structure and receive medical attention."
